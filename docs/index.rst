The visualize portlet is just a simple demonstration graph tool that allows users to see the graphical visualisation of the results output file, which has been generated using the infection model-portlet. This helps users to understand the significance of their results, by placing it in a visual context. Patterns, trends and correlations that might go undetected in text-based data can be exposed and recognized easier by making use of this tool. Consequently, when a job is ready and the output is collected, a user can upload the output file, using this portlet (infection model visualisation tool) on the science gateway and a graphical view of their jobs would be generated. This visulize tool has two major axis, namely the population and the time (in days). It also has a view to represent the different types of population. i.e the recovered, susceptible and the infected population.

Usage
============

The visualize portlet can simply be used by uploading the output file, which was generated from the infection model portlets. This is done by simply clicking on the choose file icon, on the visualzse portlet page, and users can select the appropriate output.csv file from among their experiments. This will automatically generate a graphical view of their jobs.
